## Downloads and set-up

### Vault Client

Open a terminal and run the following
``` sh
$> git clone https://github.com/scality/vaultclient.git ~/vaultClient
# clone this repository in a folder in your home
$> cd ~/vaultClient # go into the cle vault servered folder
$> npm install # install relative dependencies
```

### Vault Server

Open a terminal and run the following
``` sh
$> git clone https://github.com/scality/IronMan-Vault.git ~/vaultServer # clone the vault server repository in a folder in your home
$> cd ~/vaultClient # go into the cloned folder
$> npm install # install relative dependencies
```

## Provision your S3 account

In order to provision anything, you need to have a Vault Server running. Open a terminal and run the following
``` sh
$> cd ~/vaultServer && npm start # start your vault server
$> cd ~/vaultClient # go into the client repository for next steps
```
If you're interested in the API, or to get a more in-depth knowledge about
the next steps, please read our [Examples.md](./Examples.md)

### Create an account

Decide on a name, password, and email address for your account, and run:

``` sh
$> bin/vaultclient create-account 	--name accountName  \
									--email account@email.com \
                                 	--password accountPassword \
                                 	--host 127.0.0.1
```

### Create a user

Decide on a name, password, and email address for your user, and run:

``` sh
$> bin/vaultclient create-user 	--account-name accountName \
								--name userName \
                              	--email user@email.com \
                              	--password userpassword \
                              	--host 127.0.0.1
```

### Create an access-key for your user

Decide on a name, password, and email address for your user, and run:

``` sh
$> bin/vaultclient create-access-key 	--account-name accountName \
										--user-name userName \
                              			--host 127.0.0.1
```
The response will print something like:
``` sh
{
    "message": {
        "code": 201,
        "message": "Created",
        "body": {
            "accountName": "TestAccount",
            "userName": "TestUser",
            "status": "Active",
            "createDate": "2016-02-22T11:25:10+01:00",
            "id": "D4IT2AWSB588GO5J9T00", # save this field
            "value": "UEEu8tYlsOGGrgf4DAiSZD6apVNPUWqRiPG0nTB6" # save this field
        }
    }
}
```
Store both the ```value``` and ```id``` fields, as you will need them for next
step

## Set up your .s3fcg

Run your favourite text editor (here, we'll use vim), and open  your .s3cfg file (if you don't have one, you probably need to [install s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd))
``` sh
$> vim ~/.s3cfg
```
In this file, you need to set up the values for two fields:
 - ```access_key``` needs to be set to ```id```;
 - ```secret_key``` needs to be set to ```value```.
 From the previous example, it should be:
```
access_key = D4IT2AWSB588GO5J9T00
secret_key = UEE8tYlsOGGrgf4DAiSZD6apVNPUWqRiPG0nTB6
```

## Use s3cmd with your local S3 connector!

You can now use s3cmd with your .s3cfg file. Try
``` sh
$> s3cmd mb s3://myTestBucket
$> s3cmd ls
```
This should tell you that you have a bucket called ```s3://myTestBucket```
