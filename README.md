# Vault Client Library

[![CircleCI][badgepub]](https://circleci.com/gh/scality/vaultclient)
[![Documentation][badgegodoc]](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/scality/vaultclient/golang/vaultclient)

This repository provides a client library for any service that relies on
Vault. This repository also provides a CLI binary to interact with Vault.

This client supports a part of the protocol described in Vault's
[repository](https://github.com/scality/Vault/blob/master/Protocol.md). The
relevant parts are:

- Create account
- Generate account access key
- List accounts
- Delete account
- Authenticate V2
- Authenticate V4
- Get email addresses
- Get canonical ids

You can check our [quickstart guide](QUICKSTART.md).

## Prerequisite

To use vaultclient with an existing S3 Connector deployment, Vault requires
the use of AWS signature v4 and valid administration credentials
in its administrative interfaces (that is: to create, delete, and
list accounts, users, and access keys). To vaultcient for an existing
deployment, admin credentials need to be captured from the
supervisor node. The admin credentials are stored in the same folder as the
inventory file post S3 Connector deployment completion. For example:

```sh
$> cat federation/env/s3config/vault/admin-clientprofile/admin1.json
{
    "accessKey": "<administrative access key for Vault>",
    "secretKeyValue": "<administrative secret key for Vault>"
}
```

There are three ways of passing the content of the file to vaultclient:

* Name the file `.vaultclient.conf` and place it in your home folder; that is: `~/.vaultclient.conf`

* Set environment variable `VAULT_CONFIG` with the path of the file: `export VAULT_CONFIG=<filepath>`

* Pass the filepath in the command line with option `--config`

An example of the third option is:

```sh
$ bin/vaultclient create-account --name account0 --email d3v@null \
                                 --config <path>
```

To use it outside the S3 Connector's Docker container environment,
Vaultclient needs an environment with Node.js 10.x and the latest
version of Yarn installed.

Recommended Node version: 10.x

Node.js can be installed from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and
Yarn can be installed from [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

## Installation

Open a terminal and run the following:

```sh
# Clone this repository in a folder in your home.
$> git clone https://github.com/scality/vaultclient.git ~/vaultClient
# Go into the cloned folder.
$> cd ~/vaultClient
# Install relative dependencies.
$> yarn install
# Configure the Vault administrator credentials in the same directory,
# using the format shown in the following example.
$> cat admin.conf
{
    "accessKey": "<administrative access key for Vault>",
    "secretKeyValue": "<administrative secret key for Vault>"
}
# Use the vaultclient binary with the prefix shown in the following example.
$> ./bin/vaultclient --config ./admin.conf --host <S3C-storage-node-IP> \
    --port 8600 <subcommand>
```

Alternatively, if you are using S3 Connector storage node, vaultclient can be
found in the ```scality-vault``` Docker container.

```sh
# SSH to a storage node and exec to the scality-vault Docker container.
$> docker exec -it scality-vault bash
# Change directories to that of vaultclient.
$> cd node_modules/vaultclient/
# Configure the Vault administrator credentials in the same directory,
# using the format shown in the following example.
$> cat admin.conf
{
    "accessKey": "<administrative access key for Vault>",
    "secretKeyValue": "<administrative secret key for Vault>"
}
# You can use the vaultclient binary with the prefix described
# by the following parameters:
$> ./bin/vaultclient --config ./admin.conf --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8600 \
    <subcommand>
```

## Command-line usage

For general help, run:

```sh
$> ./bin/vaultclient -h
```

For help on a specific command, run:

```sh
$> ./bin/vaultclient subcommand -h
```

Example:

```sh
$> ./bin/vaultclient create-account -h

  Usage: create-account [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help             output usage information
    --name <NAME>
    --email <EMAIL>
```

See [examples](./EXAMPLES.md) to have an overview of all available commands.

### Command-line HTTPS support

See [examples](./EXAMPLES.md) to know how to set up https.

## Javascript API usage

See [examples](./EXAMPLES.md) to know how to set up and use the API
from javascript code.

### Javascript API HTTPS support

The programmatical client supports both the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. HTTP is
the default protocol. To enable HTTPS, set the constructor's argument ```useHttps```
to true.

See [examples](./EXAMPLES.md) to know how to see all constructor arguments.

```js
const vaultclient = require('vaultclient');

const client = new vaultclient.Client('auth.mydomain.com', 8500,
    true, // This argument set up https
);
```

To enable two way https encryption, set the constructor argument ```cert```
and ```key``` to the content of the client certificate. To use your own
certificate authority, set the constructor argument ```ca``` to the content of
your authority certificate.

### Javascript API use of Vault administration credentials

Vault administrative credentials must be passed to the constructor if using
an administrative route.

See [examples](./EXAMPLES.md) to know how to see all constructor arguments.

```js
const vaultclient = require('vaultclient');

const client = new vaultclient.Client('auth.mydomain.com', 8500, false,
    undefined, undefined, undefined, true, '7C66DCVN609K7ZHDBVZ0',
    'JXxTT04NxiWb6NcES+rpkHnkXszDq3KxexocJIJ9');

client.createAccount('account0', { email: 'dev@null' }, (err, data) => {
    console.log(data);
});
```
